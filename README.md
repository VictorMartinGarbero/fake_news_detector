# Fake News Detection using NLP

## Overview

This project aims to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of detecting fake news articles. The model processes and analyzes textual data to determine whether a given news article is fake or real. This project combines various NLP techniques, machine learning models, and data preprocessing methods to achieve accurate predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Using docker

This porject provide a docker-compose.yml file to run the project in a docker container. To run the project follow this steps:

```
docker-compose up
```

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for modeling:
      ```bash
      python src/data_preprocessing.py
      ```

2. **Model Training**: 
    - Train the model using the prepared dataset:
      ```bash
      python src/model.py
      ```

3. **Evaluation**: 
    - Evaluate the model's performance:
      ```bash
      python src/evaluation.py
      ```

4. **Prediction**:
    - Use the trained model to predict whether a new article is fake or real:
      ```bash
      python src/predict.py --text "Enter the news article text here"
      ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains news articles labeled as "fake" or "real". It can be obtained from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or other publicly available datasets. The dataset should be placed in the `data/raw` directory.

### Dataset Structure

- `title`: The title of the news article.
- `text`: The body of the news article.
- `label`: The label indicating whether the article is fake or real.

## Modeling

### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - Tokenization
   - Removing stop words
   - Lemmatization
   - Vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF)

### 2. Model Building
   - Experiment with different models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
   - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

### 3. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Use a confusion matrix to understand model performance.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on a test set to measure its performance. Key metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives.
- **Recall**: The number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set, with a precision of **Y%**, recall of **Z%**, and an F1-score of **W%**. These results indicate the model's capability to distinguish between fake and real news effectively.

## Contributing
